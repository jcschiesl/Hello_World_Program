# Hello_World_Program_Python
An intro to programming in the form of a program that reads "Hello, World! in Python."

##Process
This task was, in total not very time expensive however it gave me the fundamental
knowedge I needed as a base for the rest of my following programs and projects.
Moreover, it taught me the process of uploading my file to GitHub and 
posting it on my website. 

The cose itself needed no assistance as I have written a similar program, but in javascript. However, I ran into a problem with 
where I had the file located on my omputer and where virstual studio code was looking for it.
Dr. Benton assisted me with moving my file to the correct location, sucessfully 
outputing the "Hello, World!" text. 

I feel as if this was an educational first step in the road to becoming comfortable
in the realm of programming. Primarily, I learned how to use the resources around me to find
solutions when I am stuck.
